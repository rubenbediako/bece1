# 🔥 URGENT: Vercel KV Database Configuration Fix

## Problem: Data Not Saving After Deployment

Your BECE 2026 Prediction Platform is deployed but **data is not saving** because Vercel KV (the database) is not properly configured.

## ✅ Solution: Configure Vercel KV in 5 Steps

### **Step 1: Add Vercel KV to Your Project**

1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your `prediction-app` project
3. Go to the **"Storage"** tab
4. Click **"Create Database"**
5. Select **"KV"** (Key-Value Redis database)
6. Choose a database name: `bece-2026-kv`
7. Select region: Choose closest to your users (e.g., `us-east-1`)
8. Click **"Create"**

### **Step 2: Connect Database to Project**

1. After creating the KV database, click **"Connect Project"**
2. Select your `prediction-app` project
3. Click **"Connect"**
4. This automatically adds the required environment variables

### **Step 3: Verify Environment Variables**

1. In your project dashboard, go to **"Settings"** → **"Environment Variables"**
2. You should see these variables (automatically added):
   ```
   KV_REST_API_URL
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN
   KV_URL
   ```
3. If missing, add them manually from your KV database settings

### **Step 4: Redeploy Your Application**

```bash
# In your local project directory
git add .
git commit -m "Add database configuration"
git push origin main

# Or trigger manual deployment
vercel --prod
```

### **Step 5: Test Data Saving**

1. Open your deployed app: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
2. Login as admin
3. Try adding a subject or question
4. Check if data persists after refresh
5. Use **Database Diagnostics** button in the monitor (bottom-right corner)

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Environment Variable Setup

If automatic setup doesn't work:

### Get KV Credentials
1. Go to Storage → Your KV Database → Settings
2. Copy these values:
   - `KV_REST_API_URL`
   - `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
   - `KV_URL`

### Add to Vercel
1. Project Settings → Environment Variables → Add
2. Add each variable with its value
3. Set environment: **Production**
4. Redeploy your app

## 🚨 Quick Test Commands

### Check Current Environment
```bash
# Check if KV is connected (run in Vercel project)
vercel env ls
```

### Local Testing with KV
```bash
# Pull environment variables locally
vercel env pull .env.local

# Test locally with production database
npm run dev
```

## 📊 Database Diagnostics Tool

Your app now includes a **Database Diagnostics** tool:

1. Open your deployed app
2. Look for the sync status indicator (bottom-right)
3. Click on it to open Global State Monitor
4. Click **"Database Diagnostics"** button
5. It will test:
   - Environment configuration
   - Database connection
   - Data persistence (save/retrieve test)

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

### ✅ **Data Saving Working:**
- Admin can add subjects/topics/questions
- Data persists after page refresh
- Students see admin-added content immediately
- AI answers and podcasts are saved and cached
- Global sync works across all devices

### ✅ **Database Diagnostics Shows:**
- Environment Configuration: **OK**
- Database Connection: **Connected**
- Data Persistence: **Working**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Still Not Working:

1. **Check Vercel Logs:**
   ```bash
   vercel logs --follow
   ```

2. **Verify KV Database Status:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Your KV
   - Check if it's "Active" and "Connected"

3. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Look for database connection errors
   - Errors starting with "🔥" indicate database issues

4. **Force Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod --force
   ```

## 📞 Support

If you continue having issues:

1. Check the Database Diagnostics results
2. Share any error messages from:
   - Browser console
   - Vercel deployment logs
   - Database diagnostics output
